DESCRIPTION::
MiGrids is a clone of the 'Grids' eurorack module by link::https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids::. It's a 3-channel, algorithmic, rhythmic pattern generator based on data and models extracted from actual drum loops. Original code by Ã‰milie Gillet, link::https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master::.

Please refer to the original Grids manual for indepth information: link::https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/manual/::.


CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

ARGUMENT:: on_off
Start/stop the sequencer (0/1).

ARGUMENT:: bpm
bpm of internal clock (bpm values between 20 and 511).

ARGUMENT:: map_x
x coordinate of drum map, or number of steps (in euclidean mode), (0..1).

ARGUMENT:: map_y
y coordinate of drum map, or number of steps (in euclidean mode), (0..1).

ARGUMENT:: chaos
choas amount, or 'swing' amount, if swing is enabled (only works in 'drum mode' and with internal clock), (0..1).

ARGUMENT:: bd_dens
density of channel 1 triggers (0..1)

ARGUMENT:: sd_dens
density of channel 2 triggers (0..1)

ARGUMENT:: hh_dens
density of channel 3 triggers (0..1)

ARGUMENT:: clock_trig
Trigger or Gate input from external clock source. The number of pulses per quarter note can be adjusted with the 'reso' argument, while 24 ppqn is expected by default.

ARGUMENT:: reset_trig
Trigger or Gate input resets the sequencer.

ARGUMENT:: ext_clock
Choose sequencer clock source: internal (0) or external (1).

ARGUMENT:: mode
mode of operation. 0: drum mode (default), 1: euclidean mode. When euclidean sequencer mode is enabled, the map_x, map_y and chaos params control the duration (number of steps) of the sequence; while the density params control the fill rate.

ARGUMENT:: swing
swing mode on/off (0/1). If swing is active, the 'chaos' param sets the swing amount. (swing only works in 'drum mode' and with internal clock).

ARGUMENT:: config
config 0/1, configuration of the 'accent' outputs (4 to 6). 0: normal, outputs 4 to 6 carry accents of the respective channels (1 to 3).  1: clock_info, output 4: global accent, output 5: clock out, 6: reset/bar

ARGUMENT:: reso
set clock resolution (only settable at instantiation time!). 0: 4 ppqn, 1: 8 ppqn, 2: 24 ppqn (default).

returns:: 3 channels of trigger pulses + 3 channels of accents (or clock info)



EXAMPLES::

code::

(
{
	var x = LFNoise1.kr(0.05).range(0, 1);
	var y = LFNoise1.kr(0.05).range(0, 1);
	var chaos = 0.5;

	var pulses = MiGrids.ar(1, 133, x, y, chaos, 0.25, 0.25, 0.3);

	var ringdur = LFNoise1.kr(0.1).range(0, 2);

	var out = Ringz.ar( pulses[0..2], [300, 700, 800], ringdur, 0.05);
	Splay.ar(out);

}.play;
)


// swing...
(
{
	var bpm = 120;
	var x = 0.493;
	var y = 0.5;
	var swing_amount = 0.6;

	var mode = 0; // swing only works in 'drumming' mode
	var swing = 1;

	var pulses = MiGrids.ar(1, bpm, x, y, swing_amount, 0.39, 0.25, 0.59, mode: mode, swing: swing);

	var out = Ringz.ar( pulses[0..2], [100, 700, 1200], [1, 0.3, 0.1], 0.05);
	Splay.ar(out);

}.play;
